# Recommendation System

A hybrid recommendation system that combines **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** to provide personalized product recommendations. This system dynamically adapts to user interactions and caches results for optimized performance.

---

## Features

### 1. Content-Based Filtering
- Analyzes product features and user interactions (views and purchases) to recommend similar products.
- Builds a user profile based on recently interacted products.
- Measures similarity between user profiles and product features.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering
- Leverages a user-item interaction matrix to recommend products liked by similar users.
- Computes user similarity using **cosine similarity**.
- Dynamically updates recommendations based on new interactions.

### 3. Hybrid Recommendations
- Combines content-based and collaborative filtering results.
- Alternates between the two methods to provide diverse and relevant suggestions.

### 4. Caching
- Caches recommendations for one hour to reduce computation overhead.
- Automatically invalidates cache upon new interactions.

## How It Works

### Initialization
1. **Product Features**: Add product features (e.g., category, brand, price range).
2. **User Interactions**: Record user interactions such as views and purchases.

### Recommendation Process
1. **Content-Based Recommendations**:
   - Analyze user profiles and product features.
   - Recommend products with the highest similarity to the user's interests.
2. **Collaborative Recommendations**:
   - Identify similar users based on interaction history.
   - Recommend products liked by similar users.
3. **Hybrid Recommendations**:
   - Combine results from both methods for better personalization.

## Usage

### 1. Add a Product
```python
recommendation_system.add_product(product_id='P123', features={'category': 'electronics', 'brand': 'XYZ', 'price_range': 'medium'})
```

### 2. Record User Interaction
```python
recommendation_system.record_interaction(user_id='U456', product_id='P123', interaction_type='view')
recommendation_system.record_interaction(user_id='U456', product_id='P123', interaction_type='purchase')
```

### 3. Get Recommendations
```python
recommendations = recommendation_system.get_recommendations(user_id='U456', n_recommendations=5)
print(recommendations)
```
